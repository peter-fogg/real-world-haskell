False :: Bool

(["foo", "bar"], 'a') :: ([[Char]], Char)

[(True, []), (False, [['a']])] :: [(Bool, [[Char]])]

last :: [a] -> a

     We could return any element of the list (and still be
     well-typed). We will get back *some* element of the list, though
     -- without more knowledge of the type a, we can't apply any
     functions to the elements of the list.
