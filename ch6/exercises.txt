-- Not that I totally understand arrows, but in the context of
-- function application second takes a function and a pair and returns
-- a new pair with the function applied to the second element.

-- The type of (,) is a -> b -> (a, b). It's a constructor of pairs,
-- and so (,,) is a constructor of triples.
